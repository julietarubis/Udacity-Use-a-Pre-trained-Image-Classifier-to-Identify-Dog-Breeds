# Udacity Project: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

![Project Image](Picture_ReadMe/p1-completed-aws-udacity-Julieta_Rubis.webp)

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a project for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. The objective of this project is to use a pre-trained image classifier to identify dog breeds. The project demonstrates the application of transfer learning techniques to classify images of dogs into different breeds.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `get_pet_labels.py`: This script is responsible for extracting pet labels from the image files.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview and guidelines for the project.
- `Picture_ReadMe/`: This directory contains the images used in the README.

## Instructions

To help improve your code, consider the following recommendations:

- Implement one suggestion at a time and run your code before implementing another. This ensures that if an error occurs, you know which change led to it.
- Do not remove your own code before implementing a suggestion. Instead, comment out the part of the code you are changing.
- Always check that with each new implementation, you are still getting the correct output.
