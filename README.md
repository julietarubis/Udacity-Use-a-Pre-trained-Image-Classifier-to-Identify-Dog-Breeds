Congratulations!

Congratulations on passing the project. You did a good job overall on it. I particularly liked that when getting the pet labels in get_pet_labels.py you used the .isalpha() function. It is a robust way to filter the words that should be kept and those that should be removed when building the pet labels. Very well done!
RECOMMENDATION

To help improve your code, I have left you on the rubric items and on the code files comments with suggestions. Consider reading the comments and implement the suggestions. You will find that they enrich your knowledge and understanding. ðŸ™‚

If you do implement the suggestions, please, avoid breaking your code by following these guidelines:

    Always implement one at a time and run your code before implementing another. This will help ensure that if you do end up with an error you know which change led to it.
    Do not remove your own code before implementing a suggestion. Instead, just comment the part of the code you are changing.
    Always check that with each new implementation you are still getting the correct output.
